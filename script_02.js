//operators and conditional statements in js
 // operatoes are used to perform the operation on data

 //Arithmetic operators  (they need at least 2 operands to perform operation)

 let a=100;
 let b=120;

 console.log("a = ",a +" b =",b);
 console.log("a + b=",a + b);      //addition
 console.log("a - b =",a-b);  //sub
 console.log("a * b =",a*b); //mul
 console.log("a / b =",a/b); //div
 console.log("a % b =",a%b);  //mod
 console.log("a ** b=",a**b); //exponential


 //unary operator (they need only one operand
 //post inr/dcr
 console.log("a++ =",a++); //a=100
 console.log("a++ =",a);   //a=101      // a++ is a post increment  operator, it will first print the value then increses its value by 1

 console.log("a-- =",a--);  
 console.log("a-- =",a);       //a-- is a post decrement operator, it will first print the value of the operand then decreases by 1

 //pre inr/dcr
 console.log("++b =",++b);
 console.log("--b =",--b);    // ++b & --b are pre inr/dcr operator,they will first increse/decrease the value then print.
